# üî® DEVELOPMENT

Now that the machine is configured & applications have been installed, we can focus on installing development related needs quickly & efficiently.

## 1. ‚ö°Ô∏è Installations
We'll need xcode, Homebrew, NVM/Node/NPM, git, & VSCode Extensions installed.
- [Dev Installations](./Installations.md)

## 2. üîß Configurations
Let's configure iTerm2 with Oh-My-Zsh (Oh-My-Zsh Theme, itermcolors, `.zshrc`, aliases, & iTerm2 itself). Then we'll hit up configuring VSCode's Path for `code .` command, VSC Settings, & VSC Global Snippets for fast JavaScript coding. And finish with Folder/Directory structure & any other dev configurations for successful minimalism & productivity.
